# TRANSFER-LEARNING-MODEL-ON-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
We will use an image dataset composed of 5 classes of flowers (daisies, dandelions, roses, sunflowers, and tulips).  We will further take advantage of the Keras libraryLinks to an external site. to develop our transfer learning model, train and test it to classify our 5 different classes of flowers.
